                    Your personal information may be accessed by staff or
                    suppliers in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a
                    destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in
                    which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than
                    in the EEA. Regardless of location or whether the person is
                    an employee or contractor we will impose the same data
                    protection safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA.

                    Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the
                    European Commission as providing essentially equivalent
                    protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no
                    additional safeguards are required to export personal
                    information to these jurisdictions . In countries which have
                    not had these approvals, (see the full list here

                    , we will transfer your personal information subject to

                    equivalent data protection obligations directly on the

                    be retained until the time limit for claims in respect of
